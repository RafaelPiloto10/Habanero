# Habanero

A procedurally generated environment where Quokka-looking agents named Colokai
(prey) will try to survive in a world of llama-looking Astabbas (predators).
The Astabbas, led by their leader, Esteban Julio Ricardo Montoya de la Rosa Ram√≠rez,
will dominate the population of Colokai in the ever changing world of Habanero.
